	 * Q inverse is Q transpose; R inverse can be done by backward substitution.

	inner product. Time cost is non-zero elements in Q and R.

	 * Compute for unsure nodes.

	   * For me the LeaderRank proposed in this paper is just PageRank.
	The process of adding a ground node was long used in industry. The
	PR quoted in this paper is just one variation. 
	
	   * Personalized PageRank (PPR) subsumes both PageRank and LeaderRank.
