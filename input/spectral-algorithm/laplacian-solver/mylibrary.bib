	Complexity: m^1.5 * logM
	
	Can be further reduced to m^1.33 * logM
	
	
	General approach:
	
	 * Bi-search objective value, making it a new constraint. Optimization
	problem becomes a decision problem. 
	
	 * Form decision problem as a game where mixed strategy is allowed.
	
	 * One multiplicative update player v.s. a group of constraint players.
	
	 * Multiplicative player can do nearly as good as the best constraint.
	[arora2005multiplicative]
	
	 * Create one oracle: input the weighted constraint(from multiplicative
	player), solve the decision problem.
	
	
	The oracle:
	
	 * Electric flow, which can be solved by a Laplacian solver. 
	
	 * Best known Laplacian solver is near linear time of m, using low
	stretch spanning tree as preconditioner.
	
	 * Query time is O(m).
	
	
	Analysis:
	
	 * O(m^0.5) queries are needed for each decision problem. (p=m^0.5
	is the width of above oracle)
	
	 * Can delete edges with too much flow on it. Improve to O(m^0.33)
	number of queries.
	
	
	Question:
	
	   * logM factor is not in the final complexity? Needs further careful
	study of this paper!},

	Other articles all quote [Keith. D. Gremban 95]'s thesis, as "double
	cover". 
	
	I can not find this approach in original thesis, even similar keywords...
	
	
	Finally, I get the reduction technique in this paper. (section 3.2)},
