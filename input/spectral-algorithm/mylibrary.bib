	Hard to read. I even can not find the clue they lecture from a glimpse.
	
	It's said to use the method:(following content may not correspond
	to this paper)
	
	 * Random walk on undirected graphs stablizes at the distribution
	of degree ratio. 
	
	 * View random walk probability on edges, it becomes uniform distribution
	then. 
	
	 * Define a cumulative degree function. At steady ponit, the function
	is a straight line. 
	
	 * Prove after each step the cumulative function goes down the chords
	of previous curve. 
	
	 * The rate of mixing(the length of chord) is just the conductance.
	(use minimum conductance to bound)
	
	
	Find sets of small conductance:
	
	 * Start random walk from vertex in a set of conductance phi. 
	
	 * Walk bounded steps t. 
	
	 * For each t, get k vertices to form a set S(t,k). k vertices with
	max p(u)/degree(u). 
	
	 * Find smallest S* from S(t,k) in polynomial time. 
	
	 * Conductance of S* is bounded by O(sqrt(phi) sqrt(log(m)) ). 
	
	 * Bound can be further proved to be O( sqrt(phi) ).
