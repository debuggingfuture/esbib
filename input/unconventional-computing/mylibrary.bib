	Reversible gates:
	
	   * Have same number of inputs and outputs.
	
	   * 1-bit: identity gate; NOT gate. 
	
	   * 2-bit: XOR gate. 
	
	   * Other 2-bit gates loses information and are thus non-reversible.
	
	
	Completeness:
	
	   * NAND can perform all kinds of logic operations. 
	
	   * If a set of gates can reduce to NAND, it is complete. 
	
	   * (BTW, 1 instruction computer: decrease-if-zero-jump)
	
	
	Toffoli Gate:
	
	   * Using only 1-bit and 2-bit reversible gates are not complete.
	(NOT + XOR)
	
	   * Toffoli gate: a, b, c ==> a, b, (a AND b) XOR c
	
	   * Reversible. 
	
	   * Setting c=1, it reduces to NAND.
	
	
	Potential:
	
	   * Any reversible gate can be implemented on a quantum computer.},
